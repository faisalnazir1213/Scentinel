#App Requirements:
•	Android platform
•	Access to media files
•	Internet Connectivity

#Usage:

1. Open the app and load your image.
2. Click the ‘Show Relative Changes' button to view the values of each well
3. Enter the sample well number in the box and submit it (do this only at the end).
4. In a new prompt enter calibration solution concentrations (0, 1, 2, 3, 4...) and submit to see the tentative concentration of the sample.

*1 The processed image will be displayed as labeled objects. Processing is based on network quality (while processing it will show just a dark screen).
*2 The highest value of Relative Change or lower values in signal means the most inhibition of bacteria/most toxic effect.
*3 If it shows extra boxes after the highest concentration, enter any value more than the higher concentration they are noisy pixels due to light. 
*If there is no internet connection, or if there is a server-side issue which can happen due to upgradation, the app will crash.
